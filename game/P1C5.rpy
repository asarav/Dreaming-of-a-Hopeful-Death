    extraterrestrial "When we sent out the first of our interstellar probes in the year 3121 of the Stellar calendar era..."
    extraterrestrial "to visit our stellar neighbor, we believed what we now call the Anomaly to be a moon or satellite due to the low resolution of the images that were captured and the speed at which our probe was traveling at the time"
    extraterrestrial "At the time, we did not notice much about it other than its peculiar location."
    extraterrestrial "Typically, smaller objects are swept up within the gravitational well of the larger bodies close by."
    extraterrestrial "This usually includes planets, or the star itself."
    extraterrestrial "The prospect of something akin to the Anomaly being positioned where it was within the solar system was probabilistically low beyond any margin of error."
    extraterrestrial "It was as though it was placed there, and even if it was not, the series of events that led to its current state were beyond simple explanation."
    extraterrestrial "A primarily stationary object is definitely unique indeed and was a slight point of interest among our scientists on the first pass."
    extraterrestrial "Of course, it was nothing in comparison to the unique chemical composition of the fourth or third planet which may serve as points of settlement for future colonies."
    extraterrestrial "The third in particular had indications that its atmosphere was generated through more than simple chemical processes..."
    extraterrestrial "which led us to postulate that there was the potential for carbon based life forms that use nitrogen, oxygen, water, and carbon to survive."
    extraterrestrial "However, while these developments were exciting, the information passed back to us from our first probe was limited as a majority of the onboard equipment was dedicated to the acceleration and shielding of the probe itself."
    extraterrestrial "We needed to use pattern recognition techniques and machine learning to take an image that was captured at a quarter of the speed of light and turn it into information that we could understand."
    extraterrestrial "The machine learning models we utilized were generated by using the data we collected in prior missions that were directed towards areas that we have sent probes to in the past..."
    extraterrestrial "and comparing them with missions that were not at quite the same speed or with images collected through space telescopes."
    extraterrestrial "Turning a blur into a legible image was extremely difficult, and we could only really make imperfect approximations that were later refined by probes 2 and 3."

    extraterrestrial "Probe 2 was launched immediately after the first probe with the intention of capturing the solar system from a different angle at a slower speed using a different set of instrumentation and sensors."
    extraterrestrial "Since propulsion and speed was less of a concern with the second pass, we were not only able to take clearer images, but also increase the payload on the probe to allow for a higher number of sensors to collect more information."
    extraterrestrial "Unlike probe 1 which used a primarily photonic based form of propulsion, probe 2 used a combination of nuclear and photonic propulsion and gravity to slingshot itself towards the solar system along a slightly different trajectory."
    extraterrestrial "This made it a more economical project that could provide more data in exchange for a longer travel time."
    extraterrestrial "If probe 1 was a bullet, probe 2 was an arrow."
    extraterrestrial "Each served their own purpose in unveiling the mystery that is the cosmos."
    extraterrestrial "Upon reaching the solar system, we could gain a better understanding of the number of planets, and its general organization."
    extraterrestrial "In addition to this, we could better track the movement of the Anomaly and confirm its trajectory."
    extraterrestrial "Previously, it was as though we only knew that there was gold in a general area."
    extraterrestrial "With probe 2, we understood where to dig."
    extraterrestrial "This planet-like structure rotates periodically, and moves through space in a straight line at a speed that exponentially increases."
    extraterrestrial "Whether its velocity is increasing exponentially or along an s-curve was still to be determined at this point."
    extraterrestrial "Clearly, it did not exert the force of gravity, nor was it affected by gravity."
    extraterrestrial "Whether it was able to physically interact with other objects or had mass was questionable as well despite its physical appearance."
    extraterrestrial "It clearly reflected light, and could be seen along multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, but other properties did not follow the laws of physics that we were aware of up to that point."
    extraterrestrial "Our researchers speculated whether it was made of something other than normal matter and follows some laws of physics while ignoring others."
    extraterrestrial "There was also a question of what its top speed and starting velocity was, and whether the current speed of this object can be used to determine where it started and its relative age."
    extraterrestrial "If we had here an object that could upend our knowledge of the laws of physics, the study of it would likely result in large advancements in our science and technology."
    extraterrestrial "Here was something that was an answer to questions we asked in the past and those we had yet to ask."
    extraterrestrial "It was as though we had the answer key to a textbook full of questions that would absolutely disrupt our ways of thinking."
    extraterrestrial "However, answers alone were not enough to reverse engineer the question."
    extraterrestrial "We needed more answers and seeing how it was in our interest to eventually establish colonies, further information was needed prior to sending crewed missions and generation ships."
    extraterrestrial "A case was made, and the appropriate funding was given for the improvement of existing space travel methods as well as the development of alternate forms of interstellar travel that could be used to reduce the number of probes that needed to be sent in the long term and increase the speed at which these long journeys needed to be completed."
    extraterrestrial "In the year 3138, Probe 3 adopted a trajectory that took advantage of an alignment of four bodies: the anomaly, the third planet and its moon, and the fourth planet."
    extraterrestrial "This allowed for the probe to perform a flyby which could approach more closely and view each body in succession."
    extraterrestrial "The fourth planet held an atmosphere with properties similar to ours despite being thinner and seemingly devoid of life."
    extraterrestrial "Its atmosphere indicated that it held a dying electromagnetic field..."
    extraterrestrial "which meant that while the planet was prime for terraforming into a form that complemented our biology, doing so would be time consuming and an uphill battle."
    extraterrestrial "It was believed that we could perhaps consider bioengineering ourselves instead, but that was a consideration for a later time when we began construction of the first generation ships."
    extraterrestrial "Prior to doing so, however, were the landers and orbiters that would not only provide more detailed analyses on a constant basis, but also a less surface level (pun intended) understanding of the planets and the Anomaly itself."
    extraterrestrial "The Anomaly’s chemical composition was fascinating, but did not inform us of how it was able to treat gravity as though it was nonexistent."
    extraterrestrial "The planetoid seemed to consist of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen."
    extraterrestrial "This matched quite well with the chemical composition of the third planet’s atmosphere."
    extraterrestrial "In trace amounts were other elements such as calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur."
    extraterrestrial "Through molecular spectroscopy, we could observe that there was a high presence of water, proteins, and lipids which exceeded any margin of error."
    extraterrestrial "We had an idea of what to expect through the use of space telescopes, but the resolution and clarity of information was disappointing when compared to the quality of information provided by the probe."
    extraterrestrial "The high amount of water was interesting, but the high level of proteins and lipids indicated that perhaps this object was organic which was very bizarre."
    extraterrestrial "It is one thing for a large body to contain traces of organic matter."
    extraterrestrial "It is another thing for the body itself to be organic."
    extraterrestrial "The fringe of the scientific community posited that this was a living being or a colony of living beings that was originally formed on the third planet or constructed in space using resources originating from the third planet."
    extraterrestrial "If so, approaching the object could be considered first contact."
    extraterrestrial "While first contact may be a landmark in the advancement of our species and a milestone that we never believed to have reached this early, we needed confirmation as there were many questions such a conclusion may bring."
    extraterrestrial "How did this object enter space if it was organic?"
    extraterrestrial "If it is a form of life, was it simple or intelligent?"
    extraterrestrial "Could we communicate with it?"
    extraterrestrial "Conversely, would we want to communicate with it if we could?"
    extraterrestrial "The last question in particular was of interest to military organizations and led to an ice age in our exploration of the solar system for many decades."
    extraterrestrial "We did not know what it was, and as a result, lacked the ability to determine if it constituted a danger or not."
    extraterrestrial "If we were in a situation where we were technologically inferior to any life out there, we were unable to know."
    extraterrestrial "Similarly, we limited electromagnetic communications to within our own solar system so as to avoid alerting any malicious actors of our presence while hoping that the probes sent out on previous missions went by unnoticed."
    extraterrestrial "Our civilization entered into a cold war with life forms that were hypothetically out there and focused on the advance of technology so as to place ourselves within the best position to counter any threats."
    extraterrestrial "It was a position driven by a fear of the unknown."
    extraterrestrial "The age was one of flight despite not knowing if there was a fight to be had."
    extraterrestrial "We continued to research propulsion, physics, and improved our observational powers by placing telescopes and sensors on the edge of our solar system."
    extraterrestrial "It was a conversation where we were always listening, but never answering back and did not know who was speaking."
    extraterrestrial "The whole of our civilization, colonies and home planet included, entered into a shadow boxing match where any possibility and any assumptions of technological inferiority were considered to waterproof our defenses against the outside."
    extraterrestrial "We began by preparing for the typical attacks we may have faced: nuclear, biological, kinetic, etc."
    extraterrestrial "Once these were resolved, we considered informational vectors."
    extraterrestrial "Cyber-attacks, propaganda, mind viruses, rogue artificial intelligences and the like were carefully reviewed."
    extraterrestrial "In the process, our information technology and our understanding of mathematics grew by leaps and bounds."
    extraterrestrial "This helped us to plan against attacks beyond our understanding of the laws of physics."
    extraterrestrial "Temporal attacks, attacks from other dimensions, and the use of parallel realities as a playground to strategize against the enemy."
    extraterrestrial "We did not fully master these concepts, but we did develop strategies to recognize when such attacks would be launched against us, and how to respond accordingly."
    extraterrestrial "This was as far as we could go."
    extraterrestrial "Our curiosity and public sentiment could not be held back by fear anymore."
    extraterrestrial "Our people were descended from explorers and pioneers."
    extraterrestrial "We were meant to be out there, not to hide in the shadows."
    extraterrestrial "We could no longer fight against our nature."
    extraterrestrial "This is of course merely an excuse."
    extraterrestrial "Civil unrest and economic weakness meant that a distraction was needed."
    extraterrestrial "All the cards were already collected and our leadership knew what hand to play."
    extraterrestrial "Facing violent protests and the threat of civil war, we made the decision to resume exploration and potentially enter a new era for our species, or risk its potential destruction by continuing on this path."
    extraterrestrial "Many decades after we sent our last probe, in the year 3196 of the Stellar calendar era, the Trinity project was the next step we would take prior to sending out generation ships."
    extraterrestrial "This project consisted of three probes— each of which was a lander and an orbiter that would allow for high resolution mapping of the ground from orbit and physical analysis of the surface in multiple frequencies and spectra."
    extraterrestrial "These probes were meticulously constructed works of shining art that utilized the latest advances in material science, manufacturing, and logistics."
    extraterrestrial "From an economic standpoint, each government was mobilized to spare some level of effort towards this undertaking."
    extraterrestrial "For each probe, the majority of the mass was that of an engine whose purpose was primarily to decelerate the probe for the majority of its journey towards its target."
    extraterrestrial "Where in prior missions, shuttles and ships were unable to provide high amounts of useful data due to the speed at which they traveled, the change in focus from acceleration to deceleration provided a way to use light speed travel to gain the needed speed, but also reach appropriate velocities needed for orbital missions."
    extraterrestrial "The method of travel used within the Trinity project was as follows: the probes utilized a light sail pushed by a photonic array to accelerate to their top speed."
    extraterrestrial "Upon reaching their top speed, they immediately decelerate using rudimentary and somewhat experimental antimatter based propulsion to shave down the speed on its century long journey."
    extraterrestrial "Upon approach to the solar system of the targets, the probes will detach their antimatter engines and then use nuclear fusion and ion engines for the remainder of their travel to their destination."
    extraterrestrial "This was the sequence of events that were to be performed, and for each milestone, the generations that were there at the beginning, and the generations that succeeded them watched in suspense waiting for anything to go wrong with the complex machinery."
    extraterrestrial "It was centuries of high tension where all who stood at the forefront of the mission were on constant edge due to the complexity of the maneuvers, but also the pressure from bureaucracy to not screw up and set a negative precedent that jeopardizes any future missions."
    extraterrestrial "Fortunately, each stage, from the assembly of the orbiters and landers in zero gravity to the firing of the photonic array to the ignition and detachment of the antimatter engine occurred satisfactorily without much deviance from previously run simulations."
    extraterrestrial "In other words, operating conditions were optimal, and at the end of a century of waiting, in the year 3303 of the Stellar calendar era, we were at the end of our limited supply of patience."
    extraterrestrial "It was the time for answers."
    extraterrestrial "The second probe, the name of which roughly translates to “divine stone” in the most commonly spoken language of our civilization, was the first to enter orbit around the third planet."
    extraterrestrial "On entering orbit, it was met with a fair amount of debris which it needed to navigate around to avoid any damages."
    extraterrestrial "Analysis of this debris showed a number of shapes and features such as straight edges and right angles that occurred at a frequency that was well above that which may be considered naturally occurring."
    extraterrestrial "It is highly likely that all of these pieces were artificially made, and that they may have once been part of the same object in the past."
    extraterrestrial "There is an abundance of plastics and carbon based compounds that we have never found to have been formed naturally up to this point during our exploration of the galaxy up to this point."
    extraterrestrial "The simplest explanation is that these objects are the remnants of intelligent life that was capable of space travel."
    extraterrestrial "The lander only confirmed our suspicions once it separated from the orbiter and began its mission."
    extraterrestrial "Down at ground level, we found remnants of large cities which have been overtaken by vegetation in the form of secondary ecological succession."
    extraterrestrial "Not only is there life here, but it is thriving, and it gave birth to creatures capable of manipulating their environment and mastering it."
    extraterrestrial "The existence of this single planet has given credibility to the field of astrobiology and formed extensions of the existing fields of paleontology, anthropology, sociology and others by adding the dimension of extraterrestrial civilizations."
    extraterrestrial "The Divine Stone lander which was capable of aerial, land, and underwater travel managed to cover significant ground in an autonomous manner and was able to show us the extent of life and the ruined civilization’s progress from the way their land was utilized to multiple writing systems to their physical bipedal form which was shown to us in the form of statues and illustrations."
    extraterrestrial "Time would be needed to decode their languages, but one question was at the forefront of all others and that was why these intelligent beings which seemed to be capable of space travel abandoned their planet when it was obvious that it was not under any significant crisis."
    extraterrestrial "Core samples taken at the northernmost pole indicated an increase in greenhouse gasses."
    extraterrestrial "While a significant change in environmental conditions could indeed affect biodiversity and the like, that was not enough to explain why cities of such size did not have the remains of a population to match."
    extraterrestrial "It is unlikely that these beings were unable to utilize their technology and progress to solve such problems, so the prevailing theory was not that they were wiped out, but rather that they left."
    extraterrestrial "As to why, perhaps the other orbiters could shed light on this mystery while the Divine Stone lander continued its investigation autonomously."
    extraterrestrial "The first probe which was named Eternal Forge after an item from an ancient religion many millennia ago arrived at the fourth planet to find similar debris in orbit."
    extraterrestrial "However, the main difference is that such debris and satellites were in lesser quantities than the third planet."
    extraterrestrial "This indicated that the conditions for the intelligent life which lived within this solar system favored that of high levels of oxygen, nitrogen, and water."
    extraterrestrial "Perhaps this civilization was only just beginning to colonize its system as there is less of a presence of artifacts like the ones we found on the third planet."
    extraterrestrial "There were no large cities here, but rather small colonies which used dome structures to separate the planet’s thin atmosphere from the artificial atmosphere that was sealed in."
    extraterrestrial "Those of us observing back on our home planet immediately began designs for missions to the moons of the third and fourth planet as it was likely that similar colonies could be found in those locations as well."
    extraterrestrial "Based on the waste products of these colonies, it appeared that methane, and solar power were used to power these facilities."
    extraterrestrial "While resourceful, compared to our current stage of technological advancement, it was quite elementary."
    extraterrestrial "There were some spaceships parked nearby which had designs suited for chemical propulsion which only reinforced our impression that this civilization had their progress cut short before they could reach their full potential."
    extraterrestrial "With this in mind, we looked towards the Anomaly and asked ourselves whether that thing was a creation of these people, or if it was the reason for their ruin."
    extraterrestrial "The latter led to us second guessing our decision, but by this point it was too late."
    extraterrestrial "The third probe had already reached its destination."
    extraterrestrial "The third probe, named World Tree after a common motif in many religions of our past, was unable to enter into orbit around the Anomaly."
    extraterrestrial "The reason for this was because the Anomaly possessed no gravitational field."
    extraterrestrial "This meant that it needed to decelerate significantly more than the other probes to avoid flying away in the absence of the pull of gravity."
    extraterrestrial "Originally, we thought that due to the smaller size of the planetoid that it would have a lower gravitational pull, but the complete lack of gravity was a surprise even though this object appeared to defy the laws of physics."
    extraterrestrial "As the orbiter oriented itself towards the Anomaly, it became obvious that the lander could not be launched from the orbiter and needed to be placed on the surface."
    extraterrestrial "Until then, it was not a viable avenue for observation and exploration."
    extraterrestrial "Ignoring all laws of physics and common sense, the orbiter approached in a straight line."
    extraterrestrial "As the orbiter closed in, the discolored ball of organic matter gradually gained features."
    extraterrestrial "There were lines and bumps on the surface that did not appear to be the result of tectonics."
    extraterrestrial "While there is heat being emanated by the Anomaly, it was not quite what would be expected of a planetoid capable of volcanic activity."
    extraterrestrial "This was different."
    extraterrestrial "It acted more like a living organism with a core temperature."
    extraterrestrial "Gaining proximity, the nature of this thing became clearer."
    extraterrestrial "There were tubule-like structures spanning the entirety of the sphere."
    extraterrestrial "It was as though it was a planet-sized mass of carbon based flesh with structures resembling blood vessels or capillaries spanning the surface."
    extraterrestrial "Upon reaching a distance of meters from the surface, those bumps which were observed before took on a recognizable shape."
    extraterrestrial "It was a shape that was observed on the surface of the third planet."
    extraterrestrial "These imprints were similar to that of the faces of the beings that once ruled the third planet, each contorted into hollowed out expressions."
    extraterrestrial "It was as though each of them were perpetually frozen in some emotion."
    extraterrestrial "Whether these were expressions of euphoria or horror was something we had yet to determine at that point due to gaps in our understanding of the social behaviors of those beings."
    extraterrestrial "When we studied the third planet, we suspected that the population of intelligent beings was somewhere in the billions if their infrastructure was any indication."
    extraterrestrial "When we took the small sample size of faces we found and extrapolated them to the entire surface of the Anomaly, our calculations indicated there were billions of them all over the sphere of organic matter."
    extraterrestrial "Did the jigsaw piece fit, or was it a red herring from another puzzle set?"
    extraterrestrial "We left the lander to float towards the object, and upon contact, it just passed through as though it was not there."
    extraterrestrial "We could not study it directly."
    extraterrestrial "We could not speak to it."
    extraterrestrial "We could not greet it."
    extraterrestrial "Simply put, we did not understand it."
    extraterrestrial "What was it?"
    extraterrestrial "How old is it?"
    extraterrestrial "Why did it exist?"
    extraterrestrial "It could have been anything: the product of an intelligent civilization, a generation ship, a living being, a computer, an art installation, a shrine."
    extraterrestrial "We did not know, and at the time, we did not even remotely have the mindset nor the advancements needed to grasp what this was."
    extraterrestrial "It was only in the future as our civilization and our people changed that we understood that the mystery would haunt us and guide us on a journey across time, space, and realities where we would find that the thing we needed to understand most was ourselves."
    extraterrestrial "These first few centuries were nothing more than a warm up for the odyssey that was to come."
