    h "Prior to opening my eyes, I had what I thought was a dream."
    h "I dreamed a dream, but I don’t sleep anymore."
    h "So, that cannot be what it was."
    h "I was standing, unclothed in a grassy plain on a clear, sunny day."

    h "I have no recollection of how I arrived there, but I was there, and I was calm, as though I belonged there."
    h "The endless ripples of green which undulated up to the horizon were punctuated by clusters of trees..."
    h "and ended in a mountain range that rose up in the distance to meet cumulus clouds that filled the deep blue above with small puffs of white and gray."
    h"It was lush, it was pristine, and it was lonely: an Eden for one."
    h "I peered around to glimpse an androgynous humanoid figure in the distance atop a hill."
    h "Perhaps the figure saw me as well since it craned its neck, towards me."
    h "I ruminated on whether I should approach it for what felt like minutes, before taking my first step in the direction of the only other person I could see in this vacant land."
    h "The figure did the same, approaching me gradually, languidly swinging its arms in the same manner as me as it navigated the decline down from the hill as I climbed my way up."
    h "With the sun to its back, I had trouble making out its features."
    h "As I got closer, I could make out the details, fingers, ears, and a nose."
    h "We advanced."
    h "I was within speaking distance, ready for conversation, but I could not utter a word."
    h "The lighting did not help, so I stepped around the figure, placing the sun to my back. The figure’s head followed me, and I could finally discern the details."
    h "I could see the eyes, the color of its pupils, and the uncertainty in its gaze."
    h "There was a sense of hope on its face, as though we could reach a state of unity, friendship, or something more."
    h "Then its eyes glanced behind me, and I saw a shadow cover the sun in its eyes and the face turn to one of apprehension."
    h "I turned around to see another figure."
    h "It was one with the same face, same hands, and same body— a clone of sorts."
    h "I heard muffled footsteps and glanced in the direction of the sound to see another, and another, and another."
    h "The fields were full of them."
    h "They overcame the scenery that was there before and became the scenery."
    h "But there was one place that remained empty, and that was the sky."
    h "I stared and stared at it for the longest time, knowing what I should do but was hesitant to do so."
    h "Finally, I took a deep breath and looked down at my hands and found the same palms, the same finger prints, the same lines, the same nails."
    h "I am it and it is me."
    h "We are all the same person, experiencing different places at different times, living different lives."
    h "I knew what they were thinking, they knew what I was thinking, and yet we are separate."
    h "If I choose to, I can make myself ignorant of their thoughts, and if I choose to, I can know everything about them from the moment they were born to the person they are now."
    h "Then I blinked."

    # Scene Change
    h "There I was, floating."
    h "I was floating on my back in an endless indoor swimming pool at a recreation center of some sort when the lights were turned off."
    h "There was no one here, and only a gentle back and forth wave that echoed when it met the smooth walls of the pool."
    h "There was a deep stench of chlorine in the air mixed in with the humid atmosphere."
    h "I felt as though my entire body and I were one entity where I knew when my heart would beat, how my blood would flow, and when I would take each breath."
    h "Will there come a time when I can no longer experience this feeling?"
    h "I could sense my feet begin to drop below the surface, and noticed that there was a dark dye-like substance flowing gradually from my wrists."
    h "Blood, thick and moderately viscous. Yes, this was me trying to escape."
    h "Trying to die."
    h "Was this part of my imagination, or is this a memory?"
    h "Is this happening, did it already happen, or did it never happen at all?"
    h "Did the distinction matter anymore when it is all in my head regardless?"
    h "I tried to remember whose memories these were."
    h "Out of eight billion people, it can be hard to pinpoint who you are when you are everyone."
    h "This part of me was a teenaged swimmer, a talented one with potential who could no longer compete."
    h "What terrible luck!"
    h "If only he started a little bit earlier, he may have been able to experience death instead of joining the rest of humanity in its current existence."
    h "The roll of the dice has been unkind."
    h "My body no longer exists, this version of me no longer exists, and yet this moment feels so real to me just as it did during the time it happened."
    h "My head began to submerge, following my chest."
    h "As I sank, I could see trails of darkness following after me, my colorless dark blood painting the streaks of flowing glimmers from the window in varying shades..."
    h "like a rainbow of shadows spreading across my vision, until all I could see was black, bringing me back."

    #Scene Change
    h "I faded back to the present to my current world of black and silence."
    h "In this expanse of cold and darkness dotted by celestial bodies lightyears away in the distance, I remembered once more: "
    h "that feeling may have been real at one point, but it will never be real again outside the confines of my mind."
