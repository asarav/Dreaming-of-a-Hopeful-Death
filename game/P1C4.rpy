    p "Do you know what year it is, or how long it has been since we have been trapped in this form?"
    one_of_billions "I lost count after about twelve"
    one_of_billions "I don’t think we age anymore."
    one_of_billions "Does it still matter?"
    h "Perhaps, I did still age."
    h "Perhaps I did not."
    h "There was no mirror."
    h "I could not raise my hands to my eyes or scream in the darkness."
    h "All I had were the orbits of the planets to tell me of the passage of time."
    h "We stayed fixed in one place, never moving, never interacting with anything within the solar system."
    h "We did not revolve around a large body, and only rotated approximately a degree every five minutes or so."
    h "Each year, we were given a close glimpse of the planet we once called home as it crossed our field of vision and then left."
    h "The first day, all the lights could still be seen on the earth."
    h "Afterwards, it was complete darkness."
    h "If I knew the predicament I was in rather than simply denying it, perhaps we would have savored the sight I saw on that first day even more."
    h "Rather than wallow in disorientation, we could have lived in the moment, assuming that I am still living."
    a_child_among_billions "Is this hell?"
    a_believer "It must be"
    a_believer "Even though we were forgiven for our sins, that didn't absolve us of our responsibilities as God's creations."
    a_believer "We have sinned and this is our punishment."
    a_preacher "Then who among us is most guilty?"
    h "A preacher's voice boomed across the emptiness of space from within me."
    a_preacher "Who is the one who has doomed us to this fate?"
    h "An interesting question."
    h "Was it the soldiers that fought the wars?"
    h "No."
    h "They were the greatest patriots."
    h "Was it the serial killers and mass murderers?"
    h "Perhaps, but they were a misguided product of their society."
    h "Who among me has created those parts of me?"
    h "Mediocre parents, abusive teachers, gun manufacturers, war hungry leaders, human traffickers, drug dealers, exploitative employers, dishonest journalists, pedophiles, rapists, the authority, the elite, the vagrants."
    h "All are part of me."
    h "All of them are me."
    h "I am as guilty as I am innocent."
    h "The generation before us made us flaws and imperfections, and left us here to suffer while they could enjoy death and freedom from this form of existence."
    h "Who do I burn at the stake now that we’re here like this?"
    h "Where is the pike for me to parade the heads of the villains who created this outcome?"
    h "And who among me is most befitting of the role of executioner?"
    h "I doubt there is even one among me that is without sin, who can cast the first stone, raise the ax, and load the bullets for the firing squad."
    h "I hate so much of myself for conflicting reasons."
    h "All the imperfect and flawed individuals, no matter how high of an office or low of a position they held were me."
    h "I hate the capitalists and I also hate the communists."
    h "I hate those who are citizens of the United States, and I also hate those who are citizens of Russia."
    h "I hate one side of me, and the side I hate despises the others."
    h "The ones on the other side are the ones responsible."
    h "They are the ones who should be punished."
    h "Don't lump them in with us."
    h "Or else we, all sides, all of me, will never find peace."
    h "I am the one pursued by the mob and I am the mob itself."
    h "Indeed, we have seen moments like this before—moments where we were placed on trial, judged for our crimes, regardless of guilt or innocence."
    h "The times I have been framed for a murder and separated from my children by the justice system."
    h "I stood there in a publicized court at the mercy of a judge and jury who knew nothing about me or what I had at stake and a disinterested public defender who was overburdened by the number of cases he needed to handle."
    h "Even before the trial started, I was met with vitriol and disgust. I learned then that in the court of public opinion, I was guilty until proven innocent."
    h "Everyone wanted something from me except the things I wanted."
    h "The zealous prosecutor wanted the death penalty."
    h "He and his team fought tooth and nail ensure that I get nothing, not even a morsel."
    h "He fought for death, but I was given life in prison instead as though it was supposed to be some form of mercy."
    h "The reasoning was that the severity of the crime notwithstanding, my financial situation and my gender did not warrant an execution. I was privileged enough to avoid death, but lacking enough privilege to avoid a life of intense suffering."
    h "The humiliation I felt at that point was unbearable, as though I truly wished to repent for a crime I did not commit."
    h "It was then that I realized that justice was fickle, and that truth, regardless of its value, only had meaning when it was revealed."
    h "In the days following the trial, I was immediately sent to a high security prison without even given the chance to see my family or protest the decision in any way."
    h "My identity was overtaken by my sentence."
    h "My education, my past accomplishments, all the good I have done was replaced by what a court incorrectly decided I was."
    h "Whether it be through boredom, an unwarranted enmity, or self-hatred, those around me turned against me."
    h "However, those moments were in the minority as I spent the majority of my time in a cell, watching an unchanging scenery from behind a set of bars."
    h "Trapped ‘til death do us part."
    astronomer "There’s no need to count the years"
    astronomer "The stars can tell us exactly how long it has been."
    h "Astronomical dating."
    h "It is a possibility."
    h "But I am merely an accumulation of all living humans in the form of a single individual."
    h "I have all my senses, but I do not appear to have a human body."
    h "My vision is that of a human’s."
    h "My hearing, if it worked in this empty vacuum of space, is most likely the same."
    h "There is no air here, but if I could smell, what scent would I recognize?"
    h "Taste? Taste is not even worth mentioning."
    h "If I could speak, even if someone could hear me, what could I say?"
    h "The stars in the distance were dim and did not twinkle."
    h "There was no telescope here."
    h "No technology or tools."
    h "Nothing can be made, and nothing can be used except for my mind."
    h "Physical autonomy was a thing of the past."
    h "Sometimes, I would catch a comet or planetary bodies in the form of colored dots when the sun was behind me."
    h "It was a rough guess, but we think that it has been almost a century."
