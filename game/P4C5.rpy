    h "As reality expands infinitely, my thoughts expand as well, turning into blanks with eon long spaces between each coherent thought."
    h "It is as though I have become a tree, completely self-absorbed, unaware, and unable to respond or react to the outside."
    h "The forest may weather storms and fires, but as long as my rugged exterior can withstand the forces of nature, I can continue to exist regardless of my intentions."
    h "By this point, I ceased to care about what is happening on the outside because I would be incapable of understanding anything that is placed in front of me."
    h "In the past, when the forest was once young, there was only moss and very little forest cover."
    h "The sun was strong and its light was abundant."
    h "Now, the floor is covered in shadows, and I can no longer feel the wind and the light only touches my tops."
    h "But that is only if I were a tree in a lush forest."
    h "Here, the situation is bleaker."
    h "The senses that I remember having such as sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste have withered away and become inoperable."
    h "If I did not have the worn memories of a time when we were children of the earth, I think I would not have even believed that I held these senses to begin with."
    h "What was once a life that held the colors and hues of a vibrant painting has now become washed out and torn by the touch of infinity."
    h "The strokes are unrecognizable, and the canvas is deteriorating with detritus gathering beneath."

    h "In the moments I remember that I am a sentient being with my own thoughts, I may try to think as loudly as I can into the infinity that surrounds me or try to move a phantom limb."
    h " We would say we are here and that I am who I am."
    h "It is largely a pointless exercise, but I have been at it for so long that the practice has been made automatic almost to the point it has lost all significance."
    h "If I breathed, would my breathing be calm or ragged? Obviously ragged."
    h "Like the labored breathing of a patient on a ventilator, each thought is a monumental task."
    h "If this is a fight against entropy, I have already lost."
    h "If I had a heartbeat, would it be speeding up or slowing down? The second that death comes, I donâ€™t think I will know."
    h "It will simply be a moment when I can still realize that I am who I am and a moment where I will not even be capable of producing such a thought."
    h "The end is coming."
    h "I can feel it."
    h "It is approaching and it will be here soon."
    h "What is soon? It could be a year, a century, or another googol years."
    h "It does not make a difference."
    h "Everything will end."
    h "In this state of being where even thought is impossible, my existence is nothing short of a miracle."
    h "Despite it being a miracle, I am still unimportant."
    h "I have still been unable to make my mark."
    h "In the end, I am but a speck in a growing sea of emptiness who never mattered and never will ... I am sorry."
