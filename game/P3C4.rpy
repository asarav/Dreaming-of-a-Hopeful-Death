    h "It’s too late for us now."
    h "And it is too far for anyone to follow."
    h "There is a regret that I could not use my knowledge and insights gained through this ordeal to help others."
    h "To warn others not to follow in our steps."
    h "To tell those who come after to savor life while it lasts and how to train themselves to endure hardship."
    h "It is too late for any of that."
    h "There is no one to convey these things to, and there never will be."
    h "The lessons I learned are for me and me alone."
    h "Whomever still exists in this universe will cease to exist, and new life is gradually becoming an impossibility."
    h "The family of intelligent life is an endangered group, and though I may wish to not be alone, this wish will never come to fruition."
    h "Be it through our cosmic neighbors or through descendants, life as we know it will no longer originate within this cold space."
    voice1 "What’s done is done."
    voice1 "No use worrying about a future that will never occur."
    
    scene bg remains_of_humanity2
    
    h "Our wish to have a legacy that outlives us is also buried."
    h "We cannot have any children or anything resembling offspring."
    h "We cannot pass our teachings onto anyone, and there are many among us that think that is for the best."
    h "Our presence may be a corrupting force rather than one for good."
    h "Our universe is a putrid carcass."
    h "Our friends are lost within the infinity."
    h "Why would I want to bring anything into this dying universe when all it is going to do is starve and wither away?"
    h "If life is suffering, then I would simply be continuing the cycle."
    h "There is no Garden of Eden."
    h "We cannot be fruitful and multiply."
    h "There is no plentiful bounty provided to us by nature."
    h "We cannot fill this reality and subdue it."
    h "We cannot subdue it, raze it to the ground and pass barren land to our offspring like our forebears did."
    h "That time has passed."
    h "There is nothing left for those who follow but existential pain."
    h "To bring life into such conditions is simply cruelty."
    h "We know of what pain is in store."
    h "If we do not wish to experience it, why would our children?"

    scene bg curse_of_life
    
    voice1 "Common sense seems to trump tradition."
    voice1 "Our duty brought upon us by cultural and societal norms are irrelevant in conditions where cause and effect are seemingly absent."
    h "Indeed, I wonder if our predecessors thought the same thing."
    h "Did our parents think of the destruction and misery they would be imposing upon their children, or did they naively believe that their actions were responsible and just?"
    h "Truly, we stood on the shoulders of cannibalistic vampires."
    h "Did they even think of how we would denounce their actions as barbaric and thoughtless?"
    h "It is questionable whether they thought at all."
    h "It feels as though human attention is much like that of human vision: that which is on the periphery has minimal importance."
    h "Those who are close are the ones who matter, and the strangers of the world are worthless."
    voice1 "My child will grow to be successful, and your children are of no concern."
    voice1 "In fact, your children are competition that should be eliminated as soon as possible."
    h "We are creatures of ego toeing the line between selfishness and altruism."
    h "Sometimes altruism wins out, but usually the desires of the individual takes priority."
    h "This is particularly the case among those with low levels of self-control, empathy, long term planning or some combination of the three."
    h "This is not without reason."
    h "Our experience is ours alone."
    h "The pain of others is not ours to feel."
    h "The challenges that we face as individuals are the most immediate and pressing."

    scene bg curse_of_life2
    
    h "Our life is the only one we experience and our death is the one that ends it all."
    h "It is because of this that we are driven by our personal desires for the majority of our lives."
    h "This means that all of us knows what it means to never follow our dreams, to suffer in agony, and to wallow in disappointment."
    h "We all know what the ups and downs are, and we are well aware that it is our death which ends everything and takes away all that ails us and all that gives us joy."
    h "In the end, we are in a constant state of deprivation."
    
    scene bg forced_life
    
    h "That is what life is."
    h "Anything you gain will be lost in the end."
    h "The question is whether that loss is worth the life you lived."
    h "There is much disagreement on this matter."
    h "In the past, I used to wish I was dead."
    h "Now, I wish I had never been born."
    voice1 "To never know is to look forward to a limitless future."
    voice1 "Ignorance can have the illusion of freedom with the benefits of obliviousness to all the pain."
    voice1 "The decision to live is not a decision that we make."

    scene bg forced_life2

    h "It is made for us."
    h "It is made for us without our consent."
    h "Whether you are born into riches or born into slavery, your life is not something that you chose."
    h "In many cases, who you become and who you can become has been decided by a series of events that came into play long before you were capable of conscious thought."
    h "Life, in other words, is forced upon us and the death that follows is forced upon us as well."
    h "For the unborn, it could be said that they are the lucky ones for they never will experience death."
    h "They will never endure hardship, they will never know what it is to gain everything you wanted to only lose it all in the end."
    h "Life is a zero sum gain."
    h "You can bring your hopes up."
    h "You can think of those you love, the things you leave behind and use that to justify its worth."
    h "However, all those things are as impermanent as you."
    h "They too will not last."
    h "They too will be forgotten."
    h "It feels strange to say it, but life seems so unnatural despite it being of natural origins."
    h "We all feel that we are meant for something more, but it is truth that we were all originally born only to die."

    scene bg forced_life3

    h "We were never meant to be the final product."
    h "We were solely a footnote in a series of footnotes."
    h "It begs the question of what is the final product if it is not us."
    h "If we are only a part of the process, then that means that we were never meant to be the final product."
    h "It is as though we are a means to an end that we do not have the capacity to understand or predict."
    h "We are the tree that is to be chopped down to become lumber."
    h "Eventually that lumber will serve a purpose in the construction of other objects, but the tree will never live to see what it becomes no matter how beautiful and ornate that destiny may be."
    h "Life is a means to an end."
    h "That end is one we were meant to be around to see."
    h "Our life is merely a process that creates byproducts that can later be used by others."
    h "Nothing more, nothing less."
    h "Your life may be yours while you live it, but only then."
    h "It is nothing before and nothing after."
    h "That is not to say that it is not important."
    h "However, it is only as important as a hammer is to a carpenter or a supply chain is to an industry."
    h "It is the machine that builds what is truly needed."
    h "Just as the stars were for us, it is likely that we were the same for whatever it is that comes next."
    h "What may be, is difficult to tell in this void that permeates all of existence."
    h "Knowing that we will never know what comes after, what it is we were meant to create is one of those truths that eats away at oneself like acid on rock."

    scene bg torment_of_knowledge

    h "The knowledge and reason that we torment ourselves with is not enough to provide us with all the answers."
    h "Though we know this now, I wonder if those who brought us into this world knew as well and still did so despite knowing."
    h "There is a deep resentment for those who brought us into this life which never ends."
    h "They lived in peace, experiencing their pain for a finite period of time while I am here to rage against the shadows."
    h "I resent myself for bringing life into the world as well."
    h "To see my own children suffer the same fate that I am makes me wish that I had never created life if this was in store."
    h "There is no need for others to share the same fate and yet I, through my ignorance, selfishly brought this punishment upon them."
    h "Lo and behold: here too do I repeat the mistakes of those who came before me despite I myself being a victim of their actions."
    h "If we were never cursed, would we too have cannibalized our young as our ancestors did?"
    h "Would we too act as a drain on the youth of our successors as they march towards death by following in our footsteps?"
    h "I wonder if our current form is not much different from the form we once had."
    h "We were already cursed before."
    h "This state of being did not change that."
    h "If we were to have children through some miracle, it may indeed be true that we would betray them as our predecessors betrayed us by forcefully imposing life upon them."
    h "Life and death is the curse and nirvana is out of our reach."
    h "To never experience either is to experience true freedom through ignorance."
    h "At least then do we never experience our hopes and dreams being trampled by reality..."
    h "and ending in our passing which ultimately signifies nothing and leaves a fading legacy that too passes into insignificance with the march of time."
