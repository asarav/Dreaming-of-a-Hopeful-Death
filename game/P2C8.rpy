    h "It is like the last dance in a ballroom."
    h "You take your partnerâ€™s hand and either lead them or are led in response to the music that echoes through the lavish hall."
    h "There is a rush of euphoria that gives you momentum with each step you take that matches the beat and changes in the song accordingly."
    h "It is not only a conversation between yourself and your partner, but also between yourselves and the musicians performing at the front of the hall."
    scene bg the_last_dance_in_ballroom2
    h "The more sophisticated and difficult the movements, the greater the sense of accomplishment."
    h "Before you know it, the song is already over."
    scene bg alone_in_ballroom2
    h "You ask for one more dance, but you find yourself reaching your hand out to someone who is no longer there."
    scene bg empty_ballroom
    h "Old age has caught up."
    h "Your joints ache, and rheumatism prevents you from matching the rhythm."
    h "The music is gone."
    scene bg empty_ballroom2
    h "The lights are extinguished, and the light pouring in from the outside has been replaced by moonlight."
    h "The dance you just finished was the last one, and there will never be another one or another one like it."
    h "That was the last dance."
    h "Did we make the most of it?"
    scene bg empty_ballroom3
    h "The future is still to come."
    h "There is still the chance for possibilities and opportunities."
    h "But we know that those will vanish."
    h "Time ticks on."
    h "For us mortals bound by time, sense, and reflex, this experience that we are registering has already happened."
    h "By the time we recognize a moment to be the present, it no longer is."
    scene bg redo
    h "Enjoy the moment for it is already over."
    h "The more we understand this, the more it comes to light that the future is a past waiting for us to cognitively register it."
    h "In this sense, all that will happen already has, and we are passive observers trying to react despite operating on a time lag."
    h "The future is happening right now."
    h "The present has passed, and the past is all we know."
    h "There are no more chances, no more redoes."
    h "The time for that has long passed."
    scene bg redo2
    h "Did we do what we wanted prior to this?"
    h "Did we leave our former lives behind satisfied?"
    h "Of course not."
    h "There were still books we wanted to read and books we wanted to write."
    h "There were paths I wanted to walk and places that I wanted to see."
    h "There were chances that I did not take in the past that I hoped to take in the future."
    h "Of course those leaps of faith and chances will never come."
    h "It's too late."
    h "I can no longer face the fears I had and step bravely into the darkness to light the path ahead."
    h "All the people I wanted to meet and know better..."
    h "Yes, everyone is here already."
    h "There is no one left out."
    h "But it is not the same."
    h "It is not the same where there is just me, and everyone else is merely a part of me like many thoughts in a single head fighting for supremacy over my mind."
    h "Each part of me tells me that he or she is more interesting, that they matter more and their ideas have more significance."
    h "It simply is not the same when you are in a crowded cell, suffocating and struggling for air."
    h "Of course, there are things I still wished to do."
    h "There were cravings that lasted the eons that I want to put to rest."
    h "There are dreams I held that will need to go unfulfilled."
    h "But those dreams are not the ones I found to be the most tragic."
    h "No."
    h "It was the ones that were crushed under the weight of reality."
    h "It was the ones that had to be abandoned or suppressed so that I could live in an unforgiving world."
    h "It was the scenes where I discarded the person I thought I was meant to be and became another person instead."
    h "Looking back upon those moments is like watching us become strangers to ourselves."
    h "We no longer knew who we were, and gradually forgot the significance of our aspirations."
    h "We would keep telling ourselves, \"If I save enough money, if I do this or that... then I can finally do the things I truly enjoy.\""
    h "It was the regrets I had while on Earth that strike back the hardest now that I am on the other end of the supercluster."
    h "Even when I was aware of the things I regretted, I was unable to do anything."
    scene bg stranded
    h "Now, I do not even have the choice."
    h "I imagined myself going back in time to fix the things I believed needed fixing."
    h "I would look back upon the lives that were squandered in the pursuit of meaningless tasks and try to find the moments that would have changed everything."
    h "There were the crucial turning points where a single decision here or there could forever change the trajectory of our lives."
    h "We would tell ourselves that if we had one more chance, then we could do things right."
    h "Even in a dog-eat-dog world, if I knew what fate I would receive if I did not make the right decision, I could have rebelled."
    h "I could have tried harder."
    h "I could have leapt further, ignored the risks, and followed my heart."
    h "I would have overcome my cowardice and latched onto the destiny I wanted with the tightest grip I could muster."
    h "The lives that ended in banality could be redeemed."
    h "I could have salvaged the broken lives and turned them into stars that lit up those around them like the kindling of society."
    h "I could have done all of that..."
    scene bg stranded2
    h "if I had one more chance."
    h "Life is fragile."
    h "Any day could have been our last."
    h "I should have taken more risks, acted with more urgency, and acted with more immediacy."
    h "I could have loved more."
    h "I could have been loved more."
    h "I could have had more friends and more meaningful interactions."
    h "I could have placed myself in the right places at the right times."
    h "I could have gotten that promotion or started that company."
    h "That would have made me happy."
    h "Or would it have?"
    h "There was so much I lost in the drive to be more productive, and yet at the same time, there was so much I could have gained by increasing my productivity."
    h "The constant struggle between doing more and doing less is one of living to create a better future and enjoying a present while it is still there."
    h "Which is better?"
    h "I do not know."
    h "All I want is to be happier, and yet, I do not know what that even means."
    h "Happiness never lasts."
    h "If it did, we would grow complacent."
    h "Despite that, what does happiness matter if it is fleeting?"
    h "Does it matter at all, or is it purely a mirage in an emotional desert."
    h "We are simply vagabonds meandering through life, trying to chase the closest thing that can satisfy us."
    h "It does not matter if doing so takes us further away from a true escape or further away from fulfillment."
    h "We cannot see what is beyond the horizon."
    h "So, instead, we do what we think is best with limited information, trading the long term gratification..."
    h "for immediate satisfaction only to realize that doing so was making us stray further away from the lives we wanted to live."
    scene bg labyrinth
    h "It is as though there are three versions of us wandering a perilous maze."
    h "One rushes through without thinking of the dangers only to meet their end quickly."
    h "One avoids risks regardless of how small, and ultimately starves after being unable to take a single step forward."
    h "One observes the others, thinks, and then acts."
    h "The one who starves lives longer, but suffers till the end."
    h "The one who took on all risks suffered little, but did not live long."
    h "The one who was pragmatic lived long and suffered little as he understood that risk was relative when placed within a particular context."
    h "However, that version of us could only act on the information we had at the time."
    h "If we were to meet our end due to conditions which were out of our control, we too would perhaps regret our actions."
    scene bg labyrinth2
    h "In the end, we cannot be all versions of ourselves, and we will remain dissatisfied."
    h "As we watch our choices develop into outcomes, the lack of perfection rots us from the insides."
    h "The flaws stand out, and the victories are nothing more than expected."
    h "Those who survived till the end were the ones that wish their suffering ended sooner..."
    h "or its nature was changed while those who did not last wish that they could have lived on despite whatever suffering and horror may be in store."
    h "In the end, we realize too late that our expedition to keep our heads above water and away from the abyss was meaningless."
    h "The things we love will be perverted into something else."
    scene bg endless_cemetary
    h "Everyone we know will die."
    h "Nothing is permanent, and even if we were given a second chance, that would not change."
    h "Even if we made the right decisions, nothing would change."
    h "We would still ask for a second chance."
    scene bg endless_cemetary2
    h "That is the curse of being an inhabitant of the future and a prisoner of the past: hindsight."
    h "Nothing is perfect, and it is impossible to be so."
    h "We can make the right decisions, act optimally, and follow our principles."
    h "However, in the end, we will lust after the path not traveled."
    h "The grass beyond the horizon is greener."
    h "The mirage in the distance is lush and inviting."
    scene bg hall_of_mirrors
    h "In the hall of mirrors, the worlds behind each mirror are far more enticing than the world we are in."
    h "Whether we have no more chances, or an infinite number of chances, it's all the same."
    h "Time has passed and our mind has wandered around in mental circles."
    scene bg hall_of_mirrors2
    h "We had these very same thoughts before havenâ€™t we?"
    h "You might be able to change your future actions to some degree, but unless you can turn back the clock, the past is set in stone."
