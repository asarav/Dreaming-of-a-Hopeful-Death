    h "My childhood was a missed opportunity, but there is no reason why I cannot have another one, or many others."
    h "There were many instances where I looked at my present self and wondered when I had become an adult despite not maturing in any way."
    h "It seems as though the only difference between a child and an adult is years spent alive and physical differences."
    scene bg classroom
    h "The rest was determined by society."
    h "But here, there is no society."
    h "We can be whatever we wish and rewrite the rules as we see fit."
    scene bg school_recess
    h "Yes, here I am, there is a playground."
    h "What should I include in it?"
    h "A slide, some swings, a few trees and rocks to climb, and unlimited recess."
    h "Sounds great."
    h "But there’s something missing."
    h "Oh yes."
    h "Friends."
    scene bg school_recess2
    h "How many should I have?"
    h "I should have a lot."
    h "But that sounds tiresome."
    h "Maybe just the right amount."
    h "Yes."
    h "Just a few."
    h "Just the ones that matter."
    h "Everyone else can be a backdrop."
    h "Want to play with me?"
    h "No, you seem icky."
    h "Want to play tag? Great."
    h "You can be it."
    scene bg school_recess3
    h "Everyone gets caught except me."
    h "The playground isn't enough."
    h "There's the forest right there."
    h "What, the teachers will stop us? Fine."
    h "No more teachers then."
    scene bg picnic
    h "Or, how about a change of plans? Picnic in the woods."
    h "The whole class is invited."
    h "You can carry the picnic basket and I'll hold onto the picnic blanket."
    h "The colors are red and white of course."
    h "What are we having to eat? Some sandwiches? How traditional, but just right."
    h "A picnic basket is like a magic box! It's so big and has a handle so you can carry it."
    h "Inside, there's all sorts of yummy treats like sandwiches and fruit and cookies! You just can't beat the classics."
    h "I don't know why we did not do things like this more often."
    h "I did not learn anything in school anyways, and sniffing glue all day gets boring after a while."
    h "Let's go deeper."
    h "We have to be back in time? No we don't."
    h "Recess is forever."
    h "The fun will never end."
    h "We can forget all about homework, math, and those awful school lunches."
    h "We can be here as long as we want."
    h "There is nothing to drag us back, and there is no reason to go back."
    h "This is it."
    h "A scene of peace and serene calm."
    h "What? There is a monster? We can just slay it, like those heroes in our favorite books."
    h "Nothing can stop us."
    h "Anything is possible."
    h "This is what I missed."
    h "It's everything I wanted that I never had a chance to enjoy."
    voice1 "Enough of this."
    h "I want to experience something else."
    scene bg startup
    h "Today is a busy day like all others."
    h "I enter the campus, swipe my card, and make my way to my cubicle which has my name plate on it."
    h "The lighting is the same as it is every day."
    h "It is bright enough to read text, but dark enough to give you a headache by the end of the day."
    h "The room temperature is set to a sub 70 degree Fahrenheit level."
    h "I boot my computer up."
    h "So, what do I have on the schedule today? Yes, today we're finishing up our product and launching."
    h "The scene was electric as our leadership eagerly awaited the unveiling of the latest offering."
    h "It is not just a matter of sending out a finished product on time, but polishing it so that it is a good product rather than a mediocre one that can easily be overtaken by any competitors and upstarts."
    h "After all, first impressions are key."
    h "We need to iron out the bugs, test it multiple times, and ensure that no stone is left unturned."
    h "I take the lead, guiding and mentoring younger workers on their tasks so that we can hit the deadline without any problems."
    h "Although it takes us well into the evening, we make good progress."
    h "With careful planning and a systematic approach, we finish the day with a successful launch and good reviews."
    h "A job well done."
    voice1 "You could dream up anything and this is what you chose to think about?"
    scene bg startup2
    h "I walk into work the next day with a sense of purpose."
    h "I swipe my employee badge and stroll past security back to my desk."
    h "I set my pc up and start looking at what our tasks are for the day."
    h "I am called into a meeting with my manager and am showered with compliments."
    h "It turns out that the product launch is leading to numbers and figures that indicate a promising trend in gaining market share."
    h "Software tends to be like that."
    h "If you have a good product that gives people what they want that is lacking in the competition, you can even any gaps without necessarily needing to have many resources or even people."
    h "I do not know how much profit my actions would ultimately lead to, but what was clear was I believed in the mission."
    h "We are making the world a better place, and I am playing a large role in the journey to a better world."
    h "I matter."
    voice1 "It’s too mundane."
    scene bg meditating
    h "The temple in which I reside is usually quite peaceful and somewhat remote."
    h "The duties of a monk, while demanding a living that is lacking in modern luxuries is rewarding once appreciated."
    h "The daily routine of tending to the temple grounds can be monotonous, but the four seasons give the chores a bit of variety throughout the year."
    h "The temple, while being a place of meditation and worship, is also a reflection of my work."
    scene bg buddhist_garden
    h "Whether it is clean, whether it is ruined or well-maintained is all a result of my labor."
    h "There is always something falling apart in this aging temple, so the fine treatment witnessed here is, in some sense, proof of a lifetime of devotion and care."
    h "There is a certain level of pride in seeing the outcome of hardship that makes it seem as though it is all worth it even when knowing and understanding that the temple will still wither away over time."
    h "When I pass, when no one is around to keep this collection of stone in one piece, it will become dust."
    h "However, I still continue."
    scene bg buddhist_garden2
    h "I clean the grounds, I care for the fish in the ponds and till the stones in the garden."
    h "I continue to recite mantras and write sutras."
    h "I enjoy the peace, and I find comfort in the hardship."
    h "Suffering is a fundamental aspect of the human experience."
    h "Pain and death is as well."
    h "To be deprived of these things would mean an inhuman and lacking life."
    h "I welcome the moment, good and bad."
    h "It is all a part of a full experience."
    h "If I were at peace, maybe I could feel the same about this moment as well."
    h "In many ways, I wish for pain, suffering, and death."
    h "I wish to be human, to experience human things, to have a fear of the future or fear for a future I care about and realize the fear is merely a creation of our own making."
    h "However, the parts of me that are at peace are merely a small minority in a mob of unsatisfied and confused individuals."
    h "If I had a chance, some way to frame this as necessary and in a positive manner, perhaps we can convince the others to live in the moment."
    h "The moment is what matters, and that one should enjoy it while it lasts and not take it for granted."
    h "You do not know what the future brings, but change is inevitable."
    h "I tell the rest of myself this."
    h "Some parts of me listen."
    h "Some do not."
    h "Some progress is made, but soon, everything returns back to its original state."
    h "We want to live in the moment, but to many, this moment is a never ending disappointment that we are unwilling to accept."
