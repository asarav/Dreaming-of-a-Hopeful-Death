    h "I had once presumed I was some kind of invincible ghost unaffected by what occurs around me, but it seems as though that is not the case."
    h "There have been changes."
    h "Whether these changes are caused by the nature of the universe or the nature of my situation is questionable."
    h "What is becoming apparent is that my mind and its mental faculties are deteriorating."
    h "Simple thoughts become a chore and every act of mental labor has grown slower and slower."
    h "I can feel myself becoming stretched out over time."
    h "I no longer know if a thought takes nanoseconds, seconds, or years."
    h "Of course, it does not make a difference anymore, but there are gaps in the chain of ideas and feelings that I travel along."
    h "My memory is starting to degenerate into Swiss cheese, and I cannot do anything to reverse the onset of this mental degradation."
    h "To fight against it is like swimming against a raging current."
    h "We keep forgetting, and coherent thoughts are becoming fewer and fewer."

    scene bg abstract_degeneration_memory2

    h "If I could choose the memories that I lose, it may be acceptable, but the loss of my grip on the past is indiscriminate."
    h "It is irrelevant how important a memory may be, I can still lose it."
    h "My mind is gradually being torn from me."
    h "The things we used to identify ourselves and understand who we are incrementally disappearing."
    h "Life now is a mixture of thoughts and memories I don't wish to experience, and thoughts and memories that I will never experience again."
    h "We too are becoming a void, and the gradual decay of our mentality signifies that at some point that we will be incapable of thought."
    h "What this means is that the only thing that I can still use to convince myself that I exist will be gone."
    h "Will it be individual parts of me that drop off like flies,..."
    h "or will it be a memory of a person here and thought from another person here?"
    h "Will I cease to remember that I am the entirety of a species, or will I begin to believe that I am one human separated from the rest?"
    h "What will I be at the end of this?"
    h "I don't know, but the closest thing to the loss of all thought that I am aware of is brain death."
    h "There will be no more conscious thought and the absence of reason."
    h "As much as I believed it impossible, death is coming for us, and this time, I don't think that there is anything to stop it."
    h "Although I wish to rage against death, there is nothing I can do, and no one left here to save me."
    h "It is now that I realize what death is, and that frightens me deeply."
    h "When death comes, I will not realize it."
    h "We realize that we are to die and what that means on our deathbed."
    
    scene bg abstract_degeneration_memory3
    
    h "However, the truth is that we were already on our deathbed."
    h "We just didn’t notice yet."
    h "By the time I am dead, I will be devoid of thought and unable to comprehend whether I am living or not."
    h "Anything I wanted to do, any thought I want to have will be impossible."
    h "I will be unable to see what comes after or know what effect my death has had."
    h "Perhaps there may be an afterlife, and that could have some comfort, but if an afterlife is merely an extension of life, then all of the problems I have experienced during life will be present there as well."
    h "I wonder if an afterlife is merely nothing more than a way to calm the hearts of cowards who are unable to realize and comprehend what death is."
    h "In one moment, I have autonomy and identity."
    h "In the next, everything is taken away from me."
    h "We become nothing."
    h "We become something that is no longer us, and when it happens, we won't know."

    scene bg brain_death

    h "If we were still human, perhaps we may be given a grave."
    h "However, we will be dead, and a grave means nothing to the dead."
    h "For us who will be unable to appreciate it, it will only hold value for the living and nothing else."
    h "We have seen the deaths of many, but our own is the one that has significance."
    h "It is the one that directly affects us."
    h "Other deaths may cause sadness, but those are footnotes on our journey to the end."
    h "Like roadkill littering the streets, we did not have a second thought of those who passed away once we moved on."
    h "The corpse left behind is only there as a reminder, but it means less to us than the living being that inhabited it."
    h "Once a body is torn to shreds, mutilated, beheaded, burnt to a crisp, and becomes unrecognizable, its meaning fundamentally changes."
    h "Open casket, closed casket, missing or cremated—no one is home."
    h "The more I ponder the physical nature of death, the more alien the human body seems to me."
    h "There is no reason why our worth and our ideation should be dependent upon the physical nature of our existence and yet we cannot imagine ourselves without it."
    h "We can’t think of ourselves as anything else other than a collection of arms, legs, eyes, and meat, but we never think of the individual parts."
    h "All of it is us, and all of it affects how we think."
    h "When we turn off a machine, we do not consider it to be dead."

    scene bg brain_death2

    h "However, when a human becomes brain dead, that human is."
    h "If a machine is broken, if its data can be transferred to another body, it can be born anew."
    h "Perhaps human life is identical and we simply need to rerun our source code to wake up from death like a robot may wake up when its batteries are recharged and it is turned back on."
    h "If given an infinite amount of time, could it be possible that we can be reborn through completely random processes..."
    h "like a work of Shakespeare born from typewriters operated by monkeys with no time limit?"
    h "Maybe there are many people who are waiting to be reborn in a new form that transcends the biological and physical substrate we are so familiar with."
    h "We could instead be reborn as creatures whose thoughts travel across the universe at the speed of light on the back of subatomic particles."
    h "It is wishful thinking, but among the many promises of an afterlife, it is also not the most unreasonable."
    h "This reflection on what death may be has led me to admire those who were able to live while risking death and those who truly understood what death was, but were able to give up their lives in self-sacrifice regardless."
    h "I have often asked, what is worse: living afraid of death, living unafraid of death, not living at all despite being alive, or to never live at all."
    h "To not live despite being living is obviously worse than many of the other possibilities."
    h "It is regretful to not make the best of life while you have it."
    h "However, what of the other possibilities? To be afraid of death could indeed be counterproductive, but if one is not aware of death, one cannot value life."
    h "This provides a quandary where one must accept a certain level of risk to live their life to the fullest while minimizing risk so that such a life is not cut too short."
    h "There is a balance there that I have not appreciated in the past for good reason."
    h "If a person were to contemplate their death every waking moment, nothing can happen."
    h "I do not think that we humans, despite our intelligence, have evolved to do such a thing."
    h "On an individual scale, death is always in the background."
    h "It is rarely front and center on our list of concerns."
    h "An afterlife can be a crutch to overcome such fears, but it can be a distraction as well."
    h "There has been no shortage of stupidity that has used an afterlife to justify acts which contained a chance of death."
    h "It is one thing to not fear death while living for the promise of an afterlife."
    h "It is another to not fear death while living with no guarantee of an afterlife."
    h "I do not know where people can find the courage to overcome such fears, but for those who have faced death and lived, they have believed that there are things worth risking life for."
    h "Be it family, country, friends, or the greater good, there was something which became the crowning jewel of a life well lived to justify the sacrifice."
    h "What that is for us, I do not know."
    h "In a reality where none of those things exist anymore, there is nothing to make us rush bravely into death as we have once done."
    h "It is here that I recognize that life has never truly been important in the grand scheme of things."
    h "It is of value to me."
    h "However, that is only because I am alive."

    scene bg brain_death3

    h "Is it of value to the dead or the unborn? I'm not so sure about that."
    h "It is important to those who benefit from me being alive."
    h "Not too surprisingly, those individuals are alive as well."
    h "So, it stands to reason that life is only of value for the living."
    h "What that value is, is questionable."
    h "I feel like life should not be quantified in dollars and currency, but the past suggests that it clearly can."
    h "Each organ has its own value."
    h "Be it in the black market, or in health care, every procedure has a price tag."
    h "If you add the value of all the parts of the human body, do you arrive at the value of a human? I don't think so, but I think that a human is more than the sum of their parts."
    h "They are also the sum of their actions."
    h "What it is that a person does during their life and what they are capable of is also of value."
    h "If not, how would workplaces have ultimately decided who to hire and who to lay off? Obviously, there is a comparison of values and traits."
    h "The slave trade which continued in some form from the birth of civilization to modern times also tried to place a price on individuals."
    h "However, it was a very crude form of measurement due to the fact that a slave's potential was never considered nor fulfilled."
    h "A slave is cheap labor."
    h "What they were capable of was of no interest to their owners."
    h "If we were to apply the concepts of scarcity and supply and demand, then the question of whether humans were more valuable in the past compared to today arises."
    h "At times when humans were fewer, they could be said to be more valuable."
    
    scene bg torn_psyche
    
    h "However, one aspect of this value is missed and that is the temporal aspect."
    h "As time passes, the effect one can have on the future decreases as well."
    h "It is easier to have a greater influence on the future of civilization when civilization was just beginning to form."
    h " Were those humans worth more? In modern times when the human population was high, there was more where that came from."
    h "However, now, in this moment, it seems like a commodity that can never exist ever again."
    h "Perhaps it is within that scarcity that it has value."
    h "However, there is only value when there is demand."
    h "As everyone dies off, demand dies off with it."

    scene bg unraveling_self

    h "Simply put, the dead are incapable of desiring life, and in this realm of nothing, once I am gone, there will be no one alive to wish to stay alive."
    h "Do we have a duty as the last of our kind to remember those who came before us?"
    h "I don’t know."
    h "Should we not remember them so that they do not die a second death?"
    h "Or is that simply entrapment?"
    h "Would we instead have been made prisoners of the dead who no longer concern themselves with the living?"
    h "It is likely."
    h "If the dead could speak, would they say anything differently that what we already have?"
    h "I think not."
    h "Life is a selfish existence that desires itself."
    h "Once it is gone, nothing will desire it ever again."
